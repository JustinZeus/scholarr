# AI Agent Instructions: Scholarr

Adhere strictly to these constraints.

## 1. Coding Standards (Strict Enforcement)

- **Function Length:** Maximum 50 lines of code per function. Break down complex logic into small, testable, single-responsibility functions.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstract repetitive logic immediately. No duplicate boilerplate for database queries, API responses, or error handling.
- **Negative Space Programming:** Utilize explicit assertions and constraints to define invalid states. Fail fast and early. Do not allow silent failures or cascading malformed data, especially in DOM parsing.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Flatten logic. Use early returns and guard clauses instead of deep nesting.
  no magic numbers

## 2. Domain Architecture & Data Model

- **Data Isolation:** Scholar tracking is **user-scoped**. Validate mapping/join tables; never assume global links between users and Scholar IDs.
- **Data Deduplication:** Publications are **global records**. Deduplicate via Scholar cluster ID and normalized fingerprinting prior to database insertion.
- **State Management:** Visibility and "read/unread" states exist exclusively on the scholar-publication link table, not the global publication table.
- **API Contract:** Exact envelope format required:
  - Success: `{"data": ..., "meta": {"request_id": "..."}}`
  - Error: `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "details": ...}, "meta": {"request_id": "..."}}`

## 3. Scrape Safety & Rate Limiting (Immutable)

These limits prevent IP bans and are not to be optimized away.

- **Minimum Delay:** Enforce `INGESTION_MIN_REQUEST_DELAY_SECONDS` (default 2s) between all external requests.
- **Anti-Detection:** Default to direct ID or profile URL ingestion. Name searches trigger CAPTCHAs.
- **Cooldowns:** Respect `INGESTION_SAFETY_COOLDOWN_BLOCKED_SECONDS` (1800s) and `INGESTION_SAFETY_COOLDOWN_NETWORK_SECONDS` (900s) upon threshold breaches.

## 4. Current Environment & Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.12+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy (Async/asyncpg), Alembic.
- **Frontend:** TypeScript, Vue 3, Vite.
- **Infrastructure:** Multi-stage Docker.

## 5. Domain Service Boundaries

- **Strict Modularity:** Flat files in the `app/services/` root are strictly prohibited. All business logic and routing must reside exclusively within `app/services/domains/`.

## 6. UI rules

Make sure to properly integrate tailwind in combination with the preset theming
Clarity through both styling and language are a priority. all UI elements need to have a proper reason for existing.

## 7. Testing

All tests need to be ran using containers. `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml run --rm app`
